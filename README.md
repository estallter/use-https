# use-https

This website was created at BigRedHacks 2016.

The goal was to address web security by creating easy-to-understand explanations for why certain actions are unsafe. The hypothesis is that by increasing awareness of the reasons things are insecure, the average person will be less likely ignore warnings from web browsers or other applications that claim a certain action is unsafe.

This project won the Best Data Privacy Hack and Most Security Conscious App prizes at the competition.
